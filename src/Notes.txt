Note: The engines don't pick up the messages, the messages pick up the engines
- I kno it's silly that this is still here, but this was a breakthrough

1) Make it easier to set up input in engines using messsages
    - it's just really long mate
2) Implement basic rendering engine (squares and stuff)
- look at google drive
3) Do gui (should be easy, but prolly won't be)
4) Do rest of engines as you feel like it

Engines to add:
- hud?
- component?
- object?
- physics
- camera
- assets?
- audio?
    - look at jengine 2 and javax
