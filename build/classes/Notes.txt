Note: The engines don't pick up the messages, the messages pick up the engines

1) Implement basic rendering engine (squares and stuff)
- look at google drive
2) Make it easier to set up input in engines using messsages
    - it's just really long mate

Engines to add:
- render
- state?
- hud?
- component?
- object?
- physics
- camera
- assets?
- audio?
    - look at jengine 2 and javax
- gui

Engines have automatic message that constantly tells them to send info stuff out
- realized this is not needed
    - this is needed for console until I think of something better

REALLY IMPORTANT: 
When making private datapackets in message, they gots to be static
